## What's MenuDemo ?
MenuDemo is a basic demo of a cli menu. 
This simple project was made due to an assigment given by my school professor.

## Build
In every release, there's already a MenuDemo.exe file, but if you want to, you can build it by your own.

 1. Clone the repository
```markdown
   $ git clone https://github.com/Cascian08/MenuDemo
``` 
 2. Get into the MenuDemo's folder
```markdown
   $ cd .\MenuDemo
```
 3. Make & run MenuDemo
```markdown
   $ cd .\build
   $ make
   $ cd ..
   $ .\MenuDemo.exe
```
> [!NOTE]	
> The executable will be different depending on the OS you're working on.
